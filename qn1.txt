What does f(173) print?

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
void f(int n) { 
   if (n <= 1) { 
      cout << n; 
   } else { 
      f(n / 2); 
      cout << n % 2; 
   } 
}

Answer: 10101101

Explanation:
f(173)
First the n will go into the else block as n is greater than 1.
Inside the block, a function is called with n/2 as parameter, so 173/2 = 86 is the parameter.

f(86)
n will go into the else block as n is greater than 1.
Again, a function is called with n/2 as parameter, so 86/2 = 43 is the parameter.

f(43)
n will go into the else block as n is greater than 1.
Again, a function is called with n/2 as parameter, so 43/2 = 21 is the parameter.

f(21)
n will go into the else block as n is greater than 1.
Again, a function is called with n/2 as parameter, so 21/2 = 10 is the parameter.

f(10)
n will go into the else block as n is greater than 1.
Again, a function is called with n/2 as parameter, so 10/2 = 5 is the parameter.

f(5)
n will go into the else block as n is greater than 1.
Again, a function is called with n/2 as parameter, so 5/2 = 2 is the parameter.

f(2)
n will go into the else block as n is greater than 1.
Again, a function is called with n/2 as parameter, so 2/2 = 1 is the parameter.

f(1)
n will go into the if block as n is equal to 1.
And n is printed which 1.

This 1 goes to f(2), under which n%2 is printed.
So, 2%2 = 0 is printed

This 0 goes to f(5), under which n%2 is printed.
So, 5%2 = 1 is printed

This 1 goes to f(10), under which n%2 is printed.
So, 10%2 = 0 is printed

This 0 goes to f(21), under which n%2 is printed.
So, 21%2 = 1 is printed

This 1 goes to f(43), under which n%2 is printed.
So, 43%2 = 1 is printed

This 1 goes to f(86), under which n%2 is printed.
So, 86%2 = 0 is printed

This 0 goes to f(173), under which n%2 is printed.
So, 173%2 = 1 is printed

Thus, the answer 10101101 is printed as  a whole.
